Abstract
This study investigates the challenge of maintaining a space swarm for a group
of model satellites. Each satellite is assigned random initial velocities and positions,
and the control algorithms employed are based on artificial potentials. Attractive
potentials are placed on the goal, while repulsive potentials are assigned to obstacles.
The primary objective is to ensure the viability of these control potentials, prevent
divergence of the group of model satellites under control, and achieve a stable
formation without centralized control. Two main approaches are examined for their
effectiveness in controlling the movement and location of the satellite models. In the
first approach, the focus is on maintaining a stable formation using artificial
potentials, and checking the viability on the proposed control algorithm. The
artificial potentials consist of both attractive and repulsive potentials. The attractive
potentials guide the model satellites towards a specified goal location, while the
repulsive potentials prevent collisions with obstacles and each other. This
decentralized method aims to ensure that the satellites move cohesively as a swarm
without requiring a central command system. The second approach further refines
the use of artificial potentials. Rather than letting the system determine its formation,
a given formation shape is given. This involves fine-tuning the parameters governing
the attractive and repulsive forces to achieve this formation. Both approaches are
evaluated through numerical analysis and visual simulations.
